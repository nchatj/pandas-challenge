This is an analysis of school performance utilising a number of parameters (% pass rates, budget, number of students etc.) using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas Library.

Two major observations that can be concluded from the report are that:
1. Charter schools have higher pass rates than District schools in all three parameters tracked (Math, Reading & Overall).
2. As average spending per student increases, the average math score decreases, while the average reading score remains relatively similar across all spending ranges.
